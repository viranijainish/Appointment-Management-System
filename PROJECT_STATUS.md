## 🌐 Applications Currently Running

### Backend API (.NET Core)
- **Status**: ✅ RUNNING
- **URL**: https://localhost:7041
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - GET /api/appointments
  - POST /api/appointments
  - PUT /api/appointments/{id}
  - DELETE /api/appointments/{id}

- **Status**: ✅ RUNNING  
- **URL**: http://localhost:4200
- **Features**:

  - Create/Edit appointment forms
  - Delete confirmations
  - Responsive Material Design UI

## 🎯 How to Access

1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:4200
3. **Start using the app**:

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Template Literal Syntax**: Fixed escaped backticks in TypeScript
2. **Property Initialization**: Added proper initialization for minDateTime
3. **Node.js PATH**: Temporarily added Node.js to PATH for this session
4. **PowerShell Policy**: Set execution policy to allow npm scripts

### Current Configuration:
- **Backend**: In-memory database (data resets on restart)
- **Frontend**: Development server with hot reload
- **CORS**: Configured to allow frontend-backend communication

## 🎉 Next Steps

The application is **fully functional**! You can:

1. **Test the full workflow**:
   - Create appointments
   - View appointment list
   - Edit existing appointments  
   - Cancel appointments

2. **For permanent Node.js setup** (optional):
   - Add `C:\Program Files\nodejs\` to your system PATH
   - Restart your terminal

3. **For production deployment**:
   - Use the provided Docker setup
   - Run: `docker-compose up --build`

## 📝 Notes

- Both servers are running in background processes
- Frontend automatically reloads on code changes
- Backend API uses HTTPS with self-signed certificate
- All validation rules are working (no overlapping appointments, etc.)

**🎊 Congratulations! Your Appointment Management System is live and ready to use!**
