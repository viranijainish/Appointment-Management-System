## ⚠️ Frontend Tests - **NEEDS MANUAL START**

### Issue Identified
- Angular development server needs to be started manually
- Background process startup had issues in automated environment

### Manual Startup Required
The frontend needs to be started manually using these steps:

## 🚀 **MANUAL STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS**

### Step 1: Start Backend (Already Running ✅)
The backend is already running successfully on:
- **HTTP**: http://localhost:5041
- **HTTPS**: https://localhost:7041

### Step 2: Start Frontend Manually

**Open a new terminal/command prompt and run:**

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\rvpat\Desktop\Appoinment Menagement"

# Add Node.js to PATH (if needed)
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\nodejs\

# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Start Angular development server
npx ng serve

# Or alternatively:
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✔ Browser application bundle generation complete.
Local:   http://localhost:4200/
```

### Step 3: Test the Application

1. **Open Browser**: Navigate to http://localhost:4200
2. **Test Features**:
   - ✅ View appointments (should show the test appointment we created)
   - ✅ Create new appointment
   - ✅ Edit existing appointment
   - ✅ Delete appointment
   - ✅ Form validation

## 📊 **Current System Status**

| Component | Status | URL | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----|-------|
